## Project and goals

Bootstrap project for JS/TS based in-browser game prototyping playground, similar to previous ActionScript/Starling pair.

Targets best practives of modern web development (to the reasonable extent) but favors simplicity.

Sub-goal - evaluation of coding assistants, are they any help.

## Technology stack

 * Typescript and whatever modern module system there is
 * Bundler (Vite)
 * Tests (Jest)
 * Monorepo but separate library & project for modularity
 * CI integration
